And the implementation follows the following example: Views and binding is in the view where it should and not have to deal with mix bindings on the model which was a bad decigion, logic is structured well and in place. The code is structured well and have been used with Google Code Style and Sonar Lint for linting. Documentation is added on all. 

Here you can find a very clean arch that can be used in production without any issues. And not having to deal with the mess of implementing something on the web thats completely messed up and would get you even more confused on the way of dealing with your application.
